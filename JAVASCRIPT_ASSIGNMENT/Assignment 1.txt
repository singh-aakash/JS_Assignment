Create a simple page that lets users type in some temperature value in the Fahrenheit scale and when the user clicks a “Show results” button, to show the temperature in Celsius scale. For example, if the user types in 32, your results should show “0 degree Celsius.”
Functionality
At the least, your program should allow for the following
User Input: One text field where the user will type in the temperature in Fahrenheit
Input Validation: When the “Show results” button is clicked, your program should check to see if the user has left the text field empty and also if what the user typed is a number and not anything else.
If there are problems (as in II. above) then your program should show appropriate error messages
Display results: If there are no errors and user input is valid, then your program should show the results to the user.
