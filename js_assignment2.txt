Java Script Assignments
Assignment 1: 
Create a simple page that lets users type in some temperature value in the Fahrenheit scale and when the user clicks a “Show results” button, to show the temperature in Celsius scale. For example, if the user types in 32, your results should show “0 degree Celsius.”
Functionality
At the least, your program should allow for the following
User Input: One text field where the user will type in the temperature in Fahrenheit
Input Validation: When the “Show results” button is clicked, your program should check to see if the user has left the text field empty and also if what the user typed is a number and not anything else.
If there are problems (as in II. above) then your program should show appropriate error messages
Display results: If there are no errors and user input is valid, then your program should show the results to the user.

CODE

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

    Temperature in F =<input id="num1" type="number" name="Enter the Temperature" 
    required pattern="[0-9]{3}" placeholder="please enter the temperature" value="" required>
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click</button>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script type="text/javascript">
function myFunction() {
    var x = document.getElementById("num1").value, cel = 0;
    cel = (x - 32) * 5/9;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cel + " degree celcius";
}
</script>
</body>
</html>



Assignment 2:
Write a script which uses a prompt box to get an input. Validate that the input is an Integer between 1 and 30, and then print to the page asterisks (*) to represent the number. Your script must run until you have collected 3 valid inputs as well as generate 3 outputs (one output on one line).
Example:
Input: 4
Input: 6
Input: 12
****
******
************

CODE 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>
var x = prompt("num1");
var y = prompt("num2");
var z = prompt("num3");
for(i = 1;i <= x;i++)
{
    document.write("*");
}
document.write("<br>");
for(j = 1;j <= y;j++)
{
    document.write("*");
}
document.write("<br>");
for(k = 1;k <= z;k++)
{
    document.write("*");
}
document.write("<br>");
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Assignment 3: 
Create an HTML page that will Prompt the user: 
It should take input for the number of rows and the number of columns
Then it should create a table (HTML table) with the given number of row and columns
Each cell of the table should contain the cell id (row#, col#)

CODE


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
        <head>
    <style type="text/css">
body
{ margin: 30px;
   }   </style>
   </head>
   <body>
       <table id="m1" border="2"></table>
       <form >
           <input type="button" onclick="create()" value="create table">
       </form>
<script>
   function create(){
var rows = window.prompt("enter no. of rows", 2);
var columns = window.prompt("enter number of columns", 2);
for(var i=0;i<parseInt(rows,10);i++)
{
    var r = document.getElementById('m1').insertRow(i);
    for(var j=0;j<parseInt(columns,10);j++)
{
    var x = r.insertCell(j);
    x.innerHTML = "Row-" +i+ "Column - "+j; 
}
}
}
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Assignment 4:
In this assignment, we will write a JavaScript web application called MyCalculator. All 3 files (the .js, .html and .css files should be in the MyCalculator folder and should be called MyCalculator.XXX).
The program should do the following:
-There should be one resultBox in the .html page and one runCalculator button. This should be clicked to run the program.
-Present a menu of 7 choices to the user, using a prompt:
            1. Add
            2. Subtract
            3. Multiply
            4. Divide
            5. Exponent
            6. Mean
            7. Quit
- If the user selects anything other than 1-7, the program should print an error message and ask the user to select again. Use a for loop to check this.
-If the user selects 1, the program should ask the user to enter the first number and then the second, and then print out the result in the resultBox. Then it should display the prompt menu again.
-Similar behavior for choices 2,3 and 4: for subtract, subtract the second number from the first, for divide, divide the first number by the second.
-We should do isNAN checks for all numbers. Use a for loop to check that each input is a number.
-For choice 5, the program should ask for the base, and then the exponent, and then print out the answer, using the Math.pow() method or equivalent.
-For choice 6, the program should prompt the user to input a series of numbers. The series ends, when the user enters a “***”. At this point, our program should print out the mean value, and then show the main menu prompt again.
