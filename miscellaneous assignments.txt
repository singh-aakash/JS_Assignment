Define a class Country that stores the name of the country, its population, and its area. Using that class, write a test program that creates a few countries and stores them in an array and then prints

The country with the largest area
The country with the largest population
The country with the largest population density (people per square mile)

NOTE: Write appropriate TestCases.

Write a class called Triangle that can be used to represent a triangle. It should include the following methods that return boolean values indicating if the particular property holds:

isRight (a right triangle)
isScalene (no two sides are the same length)
isIsosceles (exactly two sides are the same length)
isEquilateral (all three sides are the same length)
Write a simple tester program that creates a few triangles and asks them about their type.

NOTE: Write appropriate TestCases.

This problem has several parts:

1. Write a simple Vehicle class that has fields for (at least) current speed, current direction in degrees, and owner name.
2. Add a static field to your Vehicle class for the highest Vehicle Identification Number issued, and a non-static field that holds each vehicle's ID number.
3. Write a main method for your Vehicle class that creates a few vehicles and prints out their field values. Note that you can also write a separate tester program as well.
4. Add two constructors to Vehicle. A no-arg constructor and one that takes an initial owner's name. Modify the tester program from the previous step and test your design.
5. Make the fields in your Vehicle class private, and add accessor methods for the fields. Which fields should have methods to change them and which should not?
6. Add a changeSpeed method that changes the current speed of the vehicle to a passed-in value, and a stop method that sets the speed to zero.
7. Add two turn methods to Vehicle. One that takes a number of degrees to turn, and one that takes simply either a Vehicle.TURN_LEFT or a Vehicle.TURN_RIGHT constant. Define the two constants accordingly.
8. Add a static method to Vehicle that returns the highest identification number used so far.
9. Add a toString method to Vehicle.
10. Now Test all of the above in a main method that will be in saperate class.
